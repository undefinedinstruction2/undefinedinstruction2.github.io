      <description>I already taked about VAC and how useless it is. And recently I decided to take a closer look to it, so this is my quick analysis. My goal will be to understand how VAC execute its modules, and in a Part 2, understand those modules.
NOTE : I&amp;rsquo;m not a game hacker in the first place, so if something is not accurate, feel free to tell it.
What is it ?</description>

      <description>Hi.
Last day I did a CTF called BTSCTF, and a challenge called BtS emulator. As I&amp;rsquo;m still working on VMP virtualization currently, I&amp;rsquo;m kind good with VM stuff.
First I noticed that the binary has all its symbols in it, so easier to reverse. Then I saw that the dispatcher routine seems pretty clean.
We found the opcode related to it :
const uint8_t opcode_buffer[256] = { 0xf2, 0x72, 0x45, 0x8a, 0x72, 0xf2, 0x72, 0x6e, 0x8a, 0x72, 0xf2, 0x72, 0x74, 0x8a, 0x72, 0xf2, 0x72, 0x65, 0x8a, 0x72, 0xf2, 0x72, 0x72, 0x8a, 0x72, 0xf2, 0x72, 0x20, 0x8a, 0x72, 0xf2, 0x72, 0x70, 0x8a, 0x72, 0xf2, 0x72, 0x61, 0x8a, 0x72, 0xf2, 0x72, 0x73, 0x8a, 0x72, 0xf2, 0x72, 0x73, .</description>

      <description>Hi
Today I will show you how I&amp;rsquo;ve bypassed Forza 3 savegame encryption.
Long story short, an Xbox 360 emulator, Xenia, is currently in dev on PC, and I&amp;rsquo;ve tried my favorite game on it. But there is a problem, Forza 3 cipher its savegames, and as Xenia is in dev, Forza 3 crash when you try to load a savegame. As I did worked a lot on Forza when I was young, I tried to look around the issue and I successfully bypass the savegame encryption.</description>

      <title>🔥 Quick look around VMP - Part 2 : Code Mutation</title>

      <description>Hi
Here is my short research about VMP mutation engine.
VMProtect is a well known protection with a lot of features, its core one is its virtualization engine. It&amp;rsquo;s a very good and optimized one, even if elite crackz say that it&amp;rsquo;s not at the level of Themida. Cracking its virtualization engine is time consuming, so I&amp;rsquo;m not specialy focused on it right now. But there is another feature of VMP that is interesting for me, its code mutation engine.</description>

      <description>Hi
This is my exploration around VMProtect security. VMP is a well known protection with a lot of features, main ones are Code Mutation and Virtualization, and compared to them, this part is the simplest regarding VMP. I will talk about all of those in future posts, but now I will focuse myself on the Packing and the Import Obfuscation.
Unpacking Packing is about compressing / ciphering executable&amp;rsquo;s sections to prevent static analysis.</description>

      <description>Hi all.
Last april, I looked to a commercial software to see how it was protected. It was using Themida 3.0, a very very good virtualization with custom vms, optimized bitcode and stuff.. But after looking around it for one hour, I figured out that some very important parts of the code were not virtualized. In fact, the entier license system were clear x64 !
Today I will try to talk about it without revealing the software for obvious reasons.</description>

      <title>How inject code intro PE executables</title>

      <description>Hi, all.
Last year, I thought it could be a great idea to combine all possible ways to modify code of an executable in a thread. And one year later this is it ! the post is out ! (thanks to caffeine)
There is a lot of reason why modify / inject code in an assembled executable :
 Inject a shellcode in a legit program to make it a malware Modify a program to patch a vulnerability while the update is not available (cc 0patch) Crack a program to bypass a check Make a malware or a protection signature change to be &amp;ldquo;FUD&amp;rdquo; Code a cheat for a game (more about runtime modification) Just make a &amp;ldquo;strong&amp;rdquo; security (assembly level, more about runtime modification again)  Here is what you can do in function of each perspective.</description>

      <title>CSAW CTF 2020 : Cuba Write-Up</title>

      <description>Hi
This is my write up for the challange Cuba of CSAW CTF 2020 :
So this challenge is a CUBA program wrapped in a Windows Executable. CUBA is a GPU langage created by NVIDIA to work around GPU with high performance langage.
https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html
Luckily there is a public SDK for it, with a disassembler :
https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-binary-utilities/index.html
Using a tool called cuobjdump, we can extract the assembly code :
To extract ptx text from a host binary, use the following command:cuobjdump -ptx &amp;lt;host binary&amp;gt; And after reversing the output, we can see that it&amp;rsquo;s a simple xor looping through a ciphered flag</description>

      <title>Why last VAC Anticheat update is useless</title>

      <description>A couple of days ago, Valve released a new update for CSGO, that &amp;ldquo;improve&amp;rdquo; its already pointless anticheat. And I decided to make a thread about it because it&amp;rsquo;s stupidly funny.
The article blur In this article, they detail :
I will analyse this by paragraphs.
So let&amp;rsquo;s start with the second one, they will &amp;ldquo;restricts&amp;rdquo; the types of programs and files that can interact with the game. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know CSGO, and common programs behaviour, know that some programs that have overlays like Discord, OBS, Nvidia stuff, need to inject DLLs (see my post about hooking functions) to execute code in the CSGO process, for overlay purposes.</description>

      <description>Hi
Today I will show how I unpacked Jar2Exe protection 3.
I made a tool called Exe2Jar that unpack Jar2Exe protection 1 and 2. It was a school project so I didn&amp;rsquo;t look that much to the protection 3, and someone shown me an issue about the output of my program regarding protection 3. So I decided to rework on it, and implement the protection 3 support.

      <description>Hi
Today I will present my current project Serana.
What is it ? Serana is a .NET library that can parse windows executables
This library interpret all elements of the executable and represent them in a Object Programming way
So you can get any informations of a PE structure and modify each one of them (in the future)
These objects could be exported (raw file buffers) separately after modifying them or export the entire executable</description>

      <description>This is a part of my tutorial on how to protect windows executables, so is a little bit disconnected from my others posts, but in wait of my big tutorial I publish this anyway.
Something that you can apply with the others encryption tricks in PE files is the encryption of function, and decrypting at calling time.
I found this trick with the Zer0Mem0ry post originaly made to bypass memory signatures checks by encrypt functions at runtime.</description>

      <description>Today I will share a little tool called Exe2Jar
This is an Jar2Exe executable unpacker
Jar2exe is a wrapper cross platform for JAR files that allows the execution of JAR files through a windows, linux or mac executable while the JRE is installed.
My unpacker recover the main JAR file from these executable.
I did it for school project with the goal to make a Java program using Object Programming.</description>

      <description>One of the usefull thing in reverse engenering is xrefs (cross-references), with a complet analyse of all the PE, variables and function addresses can be linked to functions where they are called or used. This simplify drasticly the reverse engenering, but xrefs can be a problem in case of security check. If you have a big executable and you want to look at the license check system, a string like “Check License” or “Enter License” can be find easily and the xrefs associated to him will show you directly what you wanted to find.</description>

      <description>Aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui j&amp;rsquo;ai voulu faire un petit thread sur le hooking.
Le hooking de fonction est le fait de rediriger l’exécution d&amp;rsquo;une fonction d&amp;rsquo;un exécutable vers du code qui n&amp;rsquo;est pas le sien.
Ceci peut être fait en deux étapes :
 L&amp;rsquo;injection de notre code dans le process (en runtime) La redirection de la fonction quand elle est appelée  Pour l&amp;rsquo;injection de notre code, je vais utiliser une technique appelée injection de DLL, c&amp;rsquo;est une technique très utilisée quand on doit injecter du code dans un exécutable en runtime, et le rendre plus ou moins caché (exemple cheat, malware).</description>

Starting a blogspot by reversing a .Net PE sound weird to me, but I need to start somewhere :p
This a Write Up about a Korean CTF challenge, the one is named CSHARP It&amp;rsquo;s not really hard (because of .net) but I found it interresting
